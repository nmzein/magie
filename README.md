# Nemato

## About

Nemato is a gigapixel image & annotations rendering engine, built in Rust, with a modern Svelte web interface. It enables scientists to view and analyse extremely large images annotated with hundreds of thousands of annotations created by automated tools. It also allows analysis tool developers to easily integrate their tools through a powerful and flexible module interface.
